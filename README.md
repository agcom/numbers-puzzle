# Numbers Puzzle

Sliding numbers puzzle game in C, running on Windows cmd.exe.

This game was my midterm project for the **computer fundamentals and programming** university course, made in late 2018.

## Simple build & run

Open the project in [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) 17.12 (with MinGW) on a Windows OS, and hit Build and run.

> Running the game might be cumbersome; because it is now a legacy software, and it is not packaged properly.
